    "\n",
    "* How much or how many? e.g. Identifying number of new customers likely to join your company in next quarter. (Regression analysis)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Which category? e.g. Assigning a document to a given category for a document management system. (Classification analysis)\n",

This stage may take upto 50-80% of a data scientist's time as there are a vast number of possible problems that make the data \"dirty\" and unsuitable for analysis. Some of the problems you may see in data are follows:\n",

Based on the nature of analystical question asked in the first step, a data scientist may have to engineer additional features not found in the original dataset. Feature engineering is the process of using expert knowledge to transform raw data into meaningful features that directly address the problem you are trying to solve i.e. creating a BMI (Body Mass Index) from the weights and heights of individuals in the dataset. This stage will directly influence the accuracy of the predictive model you construct in the next stage. \n",

Predictive Modelling refers to the process of using probabalistic statistical methods to \"Predict\" the outcome of an event e.g. based on employee data, an organisation can develop a predictive model to identify employee attrition rate in order to develop better retention strategies.Chossing the right model could be a challenging decision as there is never a single right answer. Selecting a model involves balancing the performance and computational cost of the analysis process. Some recent approaches in predictive modelling e.g. deep learning, have been shown to offer vastly improved accuracy of results, but with a very high computational cost.\n",

Data visualisation could be thought of as an evolution of visual communication techniques as it deals with \"VISUAL\" representation of data.
